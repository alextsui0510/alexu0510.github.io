This page is just a test Homepage coded with github, no more no more. LOL! [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/alexu0510/), select a template crafted by github pages like me. You can make your own page, I bet, [veeery](http://aalexu.biz/) easily :)

Please try it a little bit [please-please](http://aalexu.biz/)!!

### Authors and Contributors.

You can @mention a GitHub username as followed which I made like a copycat below to generate a link to your own profile. The resulting (`@`... )element will link to yours' GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, ALEX TSUI (@alextsui0510), ALEX XU (@alexu0510), and BAOLIANG XU (@blxu0510) founded this stupid GitHub page [only only for fun only](http://aalexu.biz/). Now you see how simple to make a page and how ridiculous my page is :)

### Support or Contact [They-us](http://aalexu.biz/).

Having trouble with Pages Still?? Come on, I beg your forgiviness for my [dirty words](http://aalexu.biz/) in my mind which i don't want say it out to others, My level only makes me survive. Go Check out git page's professional [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and they are going to help you to sort it out definitely.
